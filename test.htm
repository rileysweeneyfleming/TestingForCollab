			<h1>Welcome to Alpha Productions!</h2>
            <p>Hello, and welcome to the Product Solution Information page for AlphaProductions! Here are AlphaProductions
				we are dedicated to the needs of our clients and will use the most efficient solutions to meet them!
				We understand how to interpret problem requirements in a way that helps us deliver the best product possible!
                For this project it was our objective to make an impact on the food security problem of the Kawartha Lakes
				and Haliburton Region. The Kawartha Lakes Food Coalition has requested AlphaProductions to help the public
				and increase food security by producing a web application that displays the locations and information on
				various Fruit Trees within the Kawartha Lakes and Haliburton Region.
            </p>
			<h3>The Client</h3>
			<p>The Kawartha Lakes Food Coalition is a not-for-profit organization that is dedicated to Food Security in the 
                Kawartha Lakes, Haliburton, and Pine Ridge regions of Ontario. Made up of members of the community, the Food
                Coalition is determined to increase Food Security by various means, including short-term relief (donations), 
                capacity-building strategies (food banks and soup kitchens), and system redesign strategies that would make
                 free food more accessible, continue the Basic Income Guarantee, increase Social Assistance rates,
                 and increase Affordable Housing, which would help eliminate the need for the first two means.
			</p>
			<h3>The Problem</h3>
			<p>According to <i>The Lindsay Advocate</i>, there are 10,000 citizens in the Kawartha Lakes region that
                don't have enough to eat. The level of food insecurity in this region is one of the larget in the province,
                sitting at 13.5% compared to the provincial average of 11.9%. Ultimately the public needs more resources.
                One resource that can be made available is information on publicly accessible Fruit-Bearing Trees in the 
                Kawarthas. Populated by the Public, Used by the Public.
			</p>
			<h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>Solving the issue of hunger in this area is a large feat. This group is not, by any means, claiming to be able 
                to solve the issue with this project. We are, however, going to help the Food Coalition with their goal to provide
                more resources to the public on the information and locations of locally-grown, publicly accessible Fruit-Bearing
                Trees in the region. This project will consist of a Map to display information and the locations of locally-grown 
                and publicly accessible Fruit-Bearing Trees, a Form for the public to use to submit new tree locations and information,
                links for the public to learn how to utilize the fruit of those trees, and guides to help the public identify trees properly.
            </p>
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            While it is our goal to let the public populate this map, it is understood that not everyone is an expert on identifying safe
                sources of food. It is going to be a part of the project that we add in measures to control the quality of the data that is 
                displayed. While essentially anything can be submitted (i.e. a Dumpster behind a restaurant) it is not in our interest to
                display such a "food source". It is also a goal to ensure people are populating the map with correct (or at least realistic)
                locations of trees. We do not want anyone adding tree data to a waterbody. This is going to be an incredible feat but we are 
                determined to ensure the quality of data and that this map will require zero maintanence once we have released it to the client.
