There will be two layers within the application. The first layer will be available to the public and enable citizens to use the ap to photograph fruit trees on public ally owned land. The ap will map the location and photograph of these trees and provide information to help identify the tree; gender, species etc and provide links to recipes and harvesting information. The public may also name these trees. The map will be created by the public for the public.

The second layer will start with a log in page for landowners to create an passworded account with their contact information. Once created, they use the ap to photograph trees on their own property, as above, the ap will map their trees, offer education and links. Only local food security programs will have access to these maps and landowner contact information. These designated agencies will be able to contact the landowner to arrange a time to come and harvest the food. Similar to Not Far Far From the Tree, the harvest can be shared equally between the harvesters/gleaners (agency staff/volunteers/high school classes/churches/service clubs/employee teams etc) landowners and food programs or in some cases the landowners might not have a need for their share and the harvest can be shared between the volunteers and the food program.

The benefits of this program will include:

Food

-provide access to healthy food for all including children, senior and adults who live with hunger and in food poverty in our communities, each tree providing as much as 15 bushes per year

-provide an opportunity to the public to be reconnected to food trees,become more aware, supportive and engaged in local urban ecology and local food.

-increase public awareness on local poverty and provide an opportunity to become engaged in effective community action throughacts of kindness for themselves and others, come together and have a direct effect on the health of our community.

Supporting Wildlife

-decrease food waste

-access local food supply supplanting a portion of our emission intense global food supply.

-act as an important addition to the CKL Bee City pollination map and help identify gaps in the current pollinator pathway informing future forestry planning

Building Community

-connect people to nature, teach them tree ecology and inspire them to adopt a more environmental sustainable life

-encourage the simple act of picking fruit which will remind/teach people the value of trees and green spaces encouraging them to become better stewards of our urban environment.

-increase social inclusion/ increasing participant health by engaging with others and connecting with neighbours through hands on effective community action.
